# CS673 Software Engineering


### Department of Computer Science


### Boston University Metropolitan College


## Project Description

In this course, students will work collaboratively on some big real-world semester-long project(s)  You can either develop the tools from scratch, or enhance the previous tools developed by previous students. These tools are part of an online project-based learning platform that is intended to be used in the academic setting. They are described as below:



*   Project requirements management tool to manage software requirements  (such as user stories) and related tasks.  (Similar software: pivotaltracker)
*   Project communication tool to facilitate the communication between members such as a virtual chat room. (Similar software: slack)
*   Issue management tool to manage the issues or bugs in the project. (Similar software: bugzilla, issue tracking in github )
*   Project portal to archive, search and view projects and ideas. 
*   Project support center to search, share, and rate tool tutorials, document templates, tips and other materials to support student projects.

You can also choose to develop these tools as either web-based apps or mobile apps. 

A team will consist of 4-7 students. To coordinate the teamwork, each team will have a team leader and a backup team leader. Every member of the team is expected to contribute a roughly equal share to the project throughout the whole process.  The single biggest determinant of success or failure of a project is the people on your team. Respect your fellow team members and commit to teamwork is the key.

 The instructor will also act as the customer of the project. The teams will interact with the customer in order to figure out **what the customer wants** and deliver the product. The payment will not be dollars, but your grade : ).


## Project Process Description

While several different software development models will be introduced in the lectures, this project will mainly adopt **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">an iterative and incremental development process.</span>** We will focus on some **_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">agile software development methodologies</span>_**, but also introduce non-agile approaches and incorporate some into our project as needed. We will have an initial planning phase (iteration 0), and then 5 development iterations (about two weeks each). _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In each development iteration a working and quality software will be produced, and each iteration is a mini-project, involving planning, requirement analysis, design, coding and testing. A short presentation with demo will be required at the end of each iteration in order to get feedback from the customer.</span>  _Every student should participate in the first iteration (about 15 minutes each) and the last iteration (about 30 minutes or more). For other intermediate iterations (about 5-10 minutes), each group can have a couple of students to present. Each student should participate at least one intermediate iteration presentation. 

We will have about 30 minutes in each class at the end (8:15-8:45 pm) to discuss any issues in project. Besides, each team may also need one or two additional hour(s) for weekly meeting.  **Meeting minutes **are required for each meeting. Students should also communicate with each other through email, phone calls, informal meeting for any questions and issues. Each student should also submit a **progress report **that records the progress in each week, plan for the next week and any issues encountered. Each group should submit a progress report that records the progress in each iteration. Meeting minutes and progress reports are shared through Google drive.


### Initial Planning Phase



1. Form teams, designate team leaders, other leader roles and responsibilities for each role.  Set up communication plan.
2. Brainstorm the requirements of the project with the customer.  Define the project title and a project vision, including purpose of the application, major functionalities and requirements etc. Research related work, describe the challenges, explore feasibility and learn tools. We will use pivotaltracker ([http://www.pivotaltracker.com/](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/)) as the requirement analysis tool.
3. Set up project environment, which include management tools and development environment. We will use GIT as the version control tool and github ([https://github.com](https://github.com/)) to host your project.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">All documents and code </span>should be configuration items and stored in your version control system.
4. Identify risks and risk retirement plan. Estimate the time, make initial coarse granularity schedule of iterations. Define quality metrics and the techniques to assure quality.
5. Draft your SPPP (Software Project Proposal and Planning) document. The template of SPPP will be given through google doc. The SPPP will include project proposal, management plan, QA plan, and configuration plan.
6. Submission: SPPP, presentation, meeting minutes, weekly report.  All should be archived in the GitHub repository.


### In Each Iteration (about every 2 weeks)



1. Planning and Requirement analysis: work with the customer to prioritize the requirements from the backlog and choose the most important ones to implement in the current iteration. It is possible to get new requirements from the customer too.  Analyze each requirement, write user stories and acceptance tests for each requirement. Break down into tasks, and estimate the time for each task and/or requirement based on the experience or the previous iteration. Do the detailed schedule for the current iteration and coarse granularity schedule for later iterations.
2. Design, implementation and testing: identify design goals, choose the proper architecture. Identify objects/classes and their attributes and operations. Apply design patterns to enhance re-usability if applicable. Refactor code on a regular basis. Apply coding standards across the team, and document source code. Testing should be in parallel with implementation. This involves unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing.  Each iteration should result in a working software that passed all tests. Draft <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SDD (Software Design Document)</span> to include software architecture, subsystem decomposition, design patterns etc. Draft <span style="text-decoration:underline;">STD (Software Testing Document)</span> to include test plans, test cases and test report.
3. All code and documentation should be subject to peer review at the end of each iteration.
4. Update SPPP, SDD, STD in each iteration. The detailed object design document can be generated based on your code, e.g. using pydoc.
5. Submission: presentation (with demo), final deployment of your software, requirement analysis on pivotaltracker, updated documents (SPPP, SDD, SDT, weekly reports, meeting minutes), as well as source code (production and test code) on GitHub. Post iteration self and peer reviews. 


## Final Project Presentation

Every student should participate in the final presentation. The final presentation should cover the whole project process and product, with more emphasis on the last iteration. All activities such as requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, management should be included. In particular, the following items should be addressed:



1. Requirement analysis: overview of functional requirements using use case diagram,  user stories (examples, total # (planned vs completed), total points), how your project track requirements and handle requirement changes, nonfunctional requirements etc.
2. Design: software architecture, database, class diagram, patterns used and etc.
3. Implementation: any special tools, experience, or techniques, refactoring examples, 
4. Testing: types of testing, test case examples, testing metrics, such as testing coverage, such as number of tests pass, number of defects etc. 
5. Project management: role assignment as well as each individual contribution, risk management, quality management, particularly quality metrics, achievements of the project, challenges in the project, lesson learned.  
6. Demo

There will be a final project evaluation form to fill out. Each student will evaluate other group's presentation in the class.


## Final Project Submission

The following items should be included:



1. Github master branch: include all documentation (final version of SPPP, SDD, test case documentation, meeting minutes, weekly report, each iteration presentation), and all source code with comments, a description of the source code folder structures.
2. Pivotal Tracker: updated requirements using user stories
3. Final software: fully deployed website or an apk file ready for installation.
4. Final presentation evaluation form, completed by each student, submitted in class.
5. Final group/self/peer review form, completed by each student, submitted on BlackBoard.


## Project Grading

Project will be graded based on the performance in each phase and the final product. Since we use an iterative and incremental process, the later iteration will be affected by the cumulative results in the previous iterations. The deliverable for the final iterations will be the whole project. Each type of activity will be evaluated in term of 0-5 scale (0: Nothing done (F), 1: Very Poor (D), 2: Poor (C), 3:  Fair (B), 4: Good  (A-), 5: Excellent (A))

Presentation: At the end of each iteration, a presentation by each group is required. Except the first planning phase, demo is required in each iteration representation. Every student is required to participate in the first and final presentation, and any one of the previous presentations.

Management/Team work: Since this is a teamwork project. Management, communication and collaboration between members are very important. This activity is evaluated based on SPPP (and how SPPP is conducted in the project), meeting minutes, weekly report, group and peer reviews, and other informal feedback.

Requirement analysis: we will mainly use pivotal tracker to manage requirement analysis. It will also affect your final software product.

Design: SDD is the main document for this activity. Again, it will also affect your final product.

Implementation: the correctness, complexity and quality of the source code source will be evaluated for this activity. Refactor is an important practice to improve the source code quality.

Test: both unit testing and system testing should be performed. STD and the test code (e.g. unit test code and selenium test scripts) are the main deliverables for this activity.

Deployment: The final software should be easily deployed on the customer environment. If it is a desktop/mobile application, an executable file should be generated in order for the customer to easily install it. If it is web-based application, it should be deployed on a web server in order for the customer to easily access it through common browser such as chrome, firefox, IE etc.

The grade for each individual member will depend on your group project grade and his/her own contribution to the project, as well as type of activities based on your role in the group. Your self- review will be a very important way to promote your own contribution in the project.
